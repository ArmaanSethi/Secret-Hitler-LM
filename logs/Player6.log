Phase: Election Discussion

```json
{
  "thoughts": "Player1 nominated Player2 and claims Player2 is fair and balanced. Player4 is asking Player1 for more information. As a liberal, I want to gather more information before voting. I need to assess Player1's reasoning and Player2's response to the nomination. It's still early in the game, so I don't have strong opinions yet. I'll voice my concerns and ask Player2 a direct question to gauge their stance.",
  "say": "Player1, thanks for the nomination. Player2, how do you feel about being nominated by Player1? What kind of policies would you prioritize if you were Chancellor?",
  "action": "pass"

  "thoughts": "Player1 is pushing Player2 hard, and Player2 is suspiciously silent. Player3 and Player4 are also expressing doubts. While I don't have enough information to be certain, the combination of these factors makes me lean towards voting NO. It's better to be cautious early on. I will vote no and continue to observe the interactions between these players.",
