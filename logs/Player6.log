Game Event: Round 137 - Player6: Thought: I am Player6, a Fascist. Player2 is also a Fascist, and Player7 is Hitler. Player7 nominated Player1, and Player1 accepted the nomination. Player2, Player3, Player4, and Player5 are all suspicious of Player7 and Player1. It is very likely that this government will fail. However, it is important to maintain my cover and avoid becoming the primary suspect. I already said that I would vote NO, so I need to stick to that. If I voted YES, I would be immediately identified as a Fascist, and I would likely be killed if the liberals win. I need to vote NO to maintain my cover and avoid immediate execution. This government will fail anyway, so I should vote NO to avoid suspicion.
Game Event: Round 137 - Player6: Player6 remains silent.
