  "thoughts": "Player4 and Player5 have already voted no, citing my support of Player2 as suspicious. Player1 is also wary. Voting yes would confirm their suspicions and make me a target. I need to try and appear less suspicious by voting no. This will delay the government, but it's better than being immediately identified as a fascist. I'll claim I'm voting no to avoid appearing too eager, given Player7 and Player1's concerns.",
  "say": "I'm voting NO as well. Given the concerns raised by Player1 and Player7, I think it's best to reject this government and get a fresh start. I don't want to be perceived as pushing too hard early on.",

Player1 is waiting to hear Player4's response. I need to be very careful.
