Game Event: Round 179 - Player4: Thought: Player3 nominated Player7, who is almost certainly a liberal. Player1 and Player2 are voting YES to appear cooperative. Player5 is also highly suspect. Player6 and Player7 are seemingly aligned against Player1, Player2, and Player4. If I vote NO, I will be the only one voting NO and it will make me look extremely suspicious, and I want to avoid that. Therefore, I need to vote YES to continue appearing cooperative, even though this government is likely to be detrimental to our cause. Perhaps I can use the chaos policies to my advantage later.
Game Event: Round 179 - Player4: Player4 says: I will vote YES, but I still have my suspicions.
