[2025-02-09 23:19:41] Game Event: Round 64 - Player4: Thought: Player3 discarded policy 2, so the policies I received are a Liberal policy and a Fascist policy. As a Liberal, I must enact the Liberal policy. This will show the other players that I am trustworthy and committed to the Liberal cause. I will enact policy 1, the Liberal policy. After enacting the policy, I will state that I received one Liberal and one Fascist policy from President Player3, and I chose to enact the Liberal policy. This will hopefully solidify my position as a Liberal in the eyes of the other players, especially Player1 and Player5, who have been supportive of me.

Enacting the Liberal policy is the only logical choice.

[2025-02-09 23:29:33] Game Event: Round 133 - Player2: Thought: I am Player2, a Fascist. Player7 (Hitler) nominated Player1. Player1 accepted and stated he will enact a Liberal policy. Player3, Player4, and Player5 are all suspicious of Player7 and Player1. Player6 is voting NO. Player7 nominated Player1 to try to appear less suspicious. If I vote YES, I will immediately be identified as a Fascist, and the Liberals will likely win. It is very likely that this government will fail. However, there is a small chance that it will pass, and if it does, Player1 will enact a liberal policy. That would be terrible for the fascist agenda. I need to vote NO, but I also need to say something to try to sow doubt about Player1's trustworthiness and to make it seem like I am also suspicious of Player7. I already said that I am concerned about Player1's quick acceptance of the nomination from Player7. I can reiterate that concern and then vote NO. This is the best way to maintain my cover and to disrupt the liberal agenda.
[2025-02-09 23:29:33] Game Event: Round 133 - Player2: Player2 says: I remain concerned about Player1's quick acceptance of Player7's nomination. I will vote NO.
