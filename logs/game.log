2025-02-10 15:03:06 - Game Event: Round 154 - Player7: Thought: Player2's nomination of me is highly suspicious, and Player1, Player2, and Player4 are trying to undermine my credibility by questioning my potential bias. Player3, Player5, and Player6 have expressed their support for me and distrust of Player1, Player2, and Player4. Player4 has asked me what I think of Player3's comment, which is also suspicious. I need to reiterate my distrust of Player1, Player2, and Player4 and state that I will act in the best interests of the Liberals if I am elected Chancellor. I will also say that I am aware of Player2's transparent attempt to appear cooperative, but that I will not let that influence my decisions.
2025-02-10 15:03:06 - Game Event: Round 154 - Player7: Player7 says: I agree with Player3, Player5, and Player6 that Player2's nomination of me is highly suspicious, and seems like another attempt to appear cooperative while undermining a known Liberal. I will act in the best interests of the Liberals if I am elected Chancellor. I am aware of Player2's transparent attempt to appear cooperative, but that will not influence my decisions. Player1, Player2 and Player4 are still the primary suspects.

2025-02-10 15:08:09 - Game Event: Round 193 - Player5: Thought: Player4 has nominated Player6, who has consistently acted in the best interests of the Liberals. Player1, Player2, and Player4 are almost certainly Fascists, and Player5 is now highly suspect. Player1 is asking Player5 what he thinks, Player2 is asking Player7 what he thinks, Player3 is asking Player5 what he thinks of Player4, and Player4 is now asking me what I think of Player6. This is a mess. I need to state clearly that I do not trust Player4, Player1, or Player2. I will also need to make it clear that I continue to be suspicious of the fact that I drew and passed two fascist policies. I will state that I think we must act now and vote YES to enact a liberal policy. I need to try to convince the group that I am trustworthy. I will also encourage Player6 to investigate or execute someone, if possible.
2025-02-10 15:08:09 - Game Event: Round 193 - Player5: Player5 says: This is a critical moment. Player4, I do not trust you, Player1 or Player2. I also recognize that I drew and passed two fascist policies, and I am still highly suspicious of myself. However, I think we must put that aside, given the circumstances. We need to vote YES to support Player6. Player6, if you are elected, I encourage you to investigate or execute someone.
