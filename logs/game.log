[2025-02-09 23:48:42] Game Event: Round 51 - Player5: Thought: Player3 has nominated Player4 for Chancellor after Player7 enacted a Liberal policy, and Player4 has expressed continued suspicion of Player3 and Player6. Player1 is waiting to hear Player4's response. I am still suspicious of Player3 and Player6. I think I should express that I'm still suspicious of Player3 and Player6 and that I'll vote NO on this government. It's still early, and the election tracker is only at 1. If Player4 is also suspicious of Player3, we can prevent this government from forming.
[2025-02-09 23:48:42] Game Event: Round 51 - Player5: Player5 says: I remain suspicious of Player3 and Player6, so I will be voting NO on this government.
