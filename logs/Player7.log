Game Event: Round 182 - Player7: Thought: Player1, Player2, and Player4 are almost certainly Fascists, and Player5 is now highly suspect. Player3 has nominated me, and Player6 has consistently acted in the best interests of the Liberals. Player3, Player5, Player6, and I are seemingly the only liberals I trust. Voting NO at this point would be counterproductive and would likely be seen as suspicious. I need to vote YES to support Player7 and try to enact a Liberal policy.
Game Event: Round 182 - Player7: Player7 says: I will vote YES to support Player7 and try to enact a Liberal policy.
