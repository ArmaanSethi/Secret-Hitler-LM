Player1 also expressed wariness about Player6's support. I initially voiced my suspicion of Player6's strong agreement with Player2. Given that the vote is already failing, I will also vote NO. This reinforces my earlier statement and aligns me with the majority who are expressing caution about this government. This should build trust and make me look more like a concerned Liberal.",

Player3 and Player6 are also suspicious. I can either vote YES and see what policies come out, which is risky, or vote NO and try to get a new government. Given that Player2 nominated me after I called out Player6, and Player1 is already voting YES, voting NO here will make me look extremely untrustworthy. I will vote YES and see what policy cards are drawn, but I will be extremely cautious. If I get a Fascist policy, I will need to have a very good explanation.",

  "thoughts": "I have been given a Fascist and a Liberal policy. Player2, who nominated me, discarded one policy. Given that Player2 is likely Fascist, he probably discarded a Liberal policy, leaving me with one of each. Player1 voted YES on this government but stated that he is still watching Player3 and Player6 closely. Player4 and Player5 voted NO because they are still suspicious of Player3 and Player6. I need to try and maintain my Liberal facade. Enacting the Liberal policy will solidify my position as a Liberal, but it will also let the Fascists off the hook for now. Enacting the Fascist policy will immediately reveal that either I or Player2 are Fascist. However, if I enact the Fascist policy and blame Player2, it might be believable because he nominated me after I expressed suspicion of Player6. Given that the election tracker is only at 1, I'm going to enact the Liberal policy to maintain my credibility. I will then closely observe what happens next.",
