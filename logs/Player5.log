Game Event: Round 159 - Player5: Thought: Player2 nominated Player7. Player1, Player3, Player4, Player5, Player6, and Player7 all suspect Player1, Player2, and Player4 as fascists. Player1 and Player2 are voting yes to appear cooperative. Player3 and Player4 have already voted NO. Player5 and Player6 are suspicious of Player2. Player7 has also stated that he thinks Player2's nomination is a ploy. This government is likely to fail regardless of my vote. Since I suspect Player2 is trying to appear to be more liberal, I will vote NO.
Game Event: Round 159 - Player5: Player5 says: I am voting NO. I agree with Player3 and Player4 that Player2's nomination of Player7 is a transparent attempt to appear cooperative while undermining a known Liberal.
