Game Event: Round 196 - Player1: Thought: Player4 has nominated Player6, a known liberal. We need one more liberal policy to lose. However, I have been appearing cooperative and voting NO now would be extremely suspicious and would raise suspicion of Player4 and Player2, who is Hitler. I need to continue appearing cooperative, but this is a last-ditch effort for the Liberals. With only one liberal policy left to enact to win the game, it is essential that this government is voted down. However, I can't afford to stand out. Player5 has been very vocal about my distrust of me and Player4, so I need to make sure that my vote does not look suspicious. I will vote NO and state my continued distrust of Player5, in the hopes that we can still win.

Game Event: Round 196 - Player1: Player1 says: I am voting NO. I still do not trust Player5.
