Game Event: Round 168 - Player3: Thought: Player2's nomination of Player7 failed. Another Liberal policy was enacted due to the election tracker. It is now my turn to nominate. Player1, Player2, Player4, and Player5 are all highly suspect. Player6 and Player7 seem to be the most trustworthy players. Since Player6 was recently Chancellor, I will nominate Player7 again. This will give Player7 another chance to enact a Liberal policy, and will reinforce the idea that I trust Player7's judgment.
Game Event: Round 168 - Player3: Player3 says: I nominate Player7 for Chancellor.
