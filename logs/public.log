[2025-02-09 23:42:32] Round 8 - Player1: Player1 says: I nominate Player2 for Chancellor. Player2, what are your initial thoughts on how we should approach this game?
[2025-02-09 23:42:42] Round 9 - Player1: Player1 says: Thanks Player2. While we wait for your thoughts, does anyone else have initial ideas on how we should approach the game?
[2025-02-09 23:42:52] Round 10 - Player2: Player2 says: Thanks for the nomination, Player1. I think we should start cautiously. It's early in the game, and we don't have much information about each other. I suggest we focus on gathering information and observing how people vote and what they say before rushing into enacting policies. I'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts on this.
[2025-02-09 23:43:02] Round 11 - Player3: Player3 says: I agree with Player2's cautious approach. It's early days, and we need to gather information. However, I think we should also be proactive in asking each other questions to try and get a better sense of where everyone stands.
[2025-02-09 23:43:12] Round 12 - Player4: Player4 says: I also agree with a cautious start, but I think we should try to get a sense of each other's voting tendencies early on. Player2, if you were President next round, who would you nominate for Chancellor and why?
[2025-02-09 23:43:22] Round 13 - Player5: Player5 says: I also agree with the cautious approach. Player2, what criteria will you use to evaluate potential Chancellor nominees?
[2025-02-09 23:43:32] Round 14 - Player6: Player6 says: I agree with Player2's approach. I think it's smart to start cautiously and gather information before rushing into anything. His earlier statement was well-reasoned.
[2025-02-09 23:43:42] Round 15 - Player7: Player7 says: I also agree with the cautious approach, but Player6's strong agreement with Player2 makes me a little suspicious. Player2, what do you think about Player6's enthusiastic support?
[2025-02-09 23:43:52] Round 16 - Player1: Player1 says: I'll vote YES for now, but I'm a bit wary of Player6's strong support for Player2. Player6, can you elaborate on why you agreed so strongly with Player2's initial statement?
[2025-02-09 23:44:02] Round 17 - Player2: Player2 says: I appreciate Player6's agreement, but I think we're all just aligned on the idea that caution is best at the start. Thanks for the nomination, Player1. I will vote YES.

[2025-02-09 23:44:22] Round 19 - Player4: Player4 says: I'm voting NO. Player3 and Player6's eagerness to agree with Player2 seems a bit too convenient. I think we should reject this government and get a new nomination.
[2025-02-09 23:44:32] Round 20 - Player5: Player5 says: I'm voting NO. I agree with Player4 that Player3 and Player6's quick agreement with Player2 seems suspicious. Let's get a new nomination.
[2025-02-09 23:44:42] Round 21 - Player6: Player6 says: I'm voting NO as well. Given the concerns raised by Player1 and Player7, I think it's best to reject this government and get a fresh start. I don't want to be perceived as pushing too hard early on.
[2025-02-09 23:44:52] Round 22 - Player7: Player7 says: I'm voting NO as well. I agree with the concerns raised by Player4 and Player5. It's better to err on the side of caution early on.
